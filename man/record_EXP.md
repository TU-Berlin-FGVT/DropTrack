# general remarks

## example

```matlab
%% process one record
config;
path = 'full_path_to_the_record';
rec = record_EXP(path);
rec.run_all();

%% access to processed data of the record
rec.drops(2).centers
rec.Events.bottomDetachmentTime
rec.Events.bottomDetachmentTime

%% access to saved processed data of the record
load([path,'\exp_data.mat']);
data.drops(2).centers
data.Events.bottomDetachmentTime
data.Events.bottomDetachmentTime
```
## units

| physical quantity | unit   |
|--- | --- |
| length | px   |
| time | frame  |
| velocitiy | px/frames|
| framerate | s/frame |
| px2mm | mm/px |

## coordinate system
The point of origin lays in the upper left corner of the rotated image:
- when the `x`-coordinate rises the direction is downwards (**v**)
- when the `y`-coordinate rises the direction is rightwards (**>**)

Therefore, the `x`-velocity is negative when the lower drop rises.

Points are defined as complex numbers:  `P(x,y) = x + y i`
